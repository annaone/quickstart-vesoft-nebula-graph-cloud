This Quick Start requires a license for {partner-product-short-name} Enterprise Edition. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, apply for a license by sending an email to inquiry@vesoft.com. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location. If you don't have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you 3 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.1.0/4.deployment-and-installation/deploy-license/#renew_a_nebula_graph_enterprise_edition_license[Renew license].
